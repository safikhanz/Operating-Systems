THIS PROJECT:
	This is an example of Memory Management making requests between a page table and frame table
	If frames are not in the page table, a page fault occurs.
	If there is a frame in the page table, the request is granted.
	If the the frame table is full, the Least recently used algorithm is implemented.

 This project is incomplete, I did not get a chance to accuqire all the statistics that were asked. 
 Memory Layout output does not work.
