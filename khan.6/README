THIS PROJECT:
	This is an example of Memory Management making requests between a page table and frame table. 
	Termination occurs after all processes (max 18) have ran for a discrete amount of time.
	If frames are not in the page table, a page fault occurs.
	If there is a frame in the page table, the request is granted.
	If the the frame table is full, the Least recently used algorithm is implemented.

 This project is incomplete, I did not get a chance to accuqire all the statistics that were asked. 
This program contains code for the message queues, the simulated clock, the arrays to hold all the
 pages, functions to kill the process and all children on interrupt, functions to determine when to
 launch a new process and basic code to fork a process.
